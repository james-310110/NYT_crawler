# NYT_crawler
A python script to crawl news articles (contents included) using a versatile filter.

Initiated from a class project in ECON1680@Brown, this project uses BeautifulSoup and Selenium to crawl text data, including headline, section, content, tags, and generate time-series data for sentiment analysis. The crawler can be modified to realize other functionalities.

\# This is a re-upload of a private project from github classroom.

Below is a brief demonstration of the results achieved from this project.
